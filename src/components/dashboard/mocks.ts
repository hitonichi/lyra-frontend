    question: 'Explain the benefits of proper inheritance.',
    answer:
      '1. Substitutability :The objects of a properly derived class can be easily and safely substituted for an object of its base class. 2. Extensibility :The properly derived class can be freely and safely used in place of its base class even if the properly derived class is created a lot later than defining the user code. Extending the functionalities of a system is much easier when you add a properly derived class containing enhanced functionalities. ',

    question: 'When should a function throw an exception?',
    answer:
      ' A function should throw an exception when it is not able to fulfil its promise. As soon as the function detects a question that prevents it from fulfilling its promise, it should throw an exception.If the function is able to handle the question, recover itself and deliver the promise, then the exception should not be thrown. If an event happens very frequently then exception handling is not the best way to deal with it. It requires proper fixation.',

Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world question with a simplified model, while variance refers to the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data. A model with high bias tends to underfit the data, while a model with high variance tends to overfit the data. The goal is to find the right balance between bias and variance to achieve optimal model performance.",

    question: 'What is cross-validation and why is it important in machine learning?',
    answer:
      "Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a machine learning model by splitting the dataset into multiple subsets (folds), training the model on some of the folds, and evaluating it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated multiple times, and the average performance across all folds is used as an estimate of the model's generalization performance. Cross-validation helps to provide a more reliable estimate of model performance and reduces the risk of overfitting.",

    question: 'What is Java and its uses?',
    answer:
      'Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation). It is widely used for developing desktop, web, and mobile applications, as well as enterprise software and large-scale systems. Java applications are platform-independent and can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.',

  {
    question: 'What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM in Java?',
    answer:
      'JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit used for developing Java applications. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a runtime environment that provides the libraries, resources, and JVM (Java Virtual Machine) required to run Java applications. JVM is a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode and provides a platform-independent execution environment for Java programs.',

    question: 'What are the different types of inheritance in Java?',
    answer:
      'Java supports four types of inheritance: single inheritance, where a class inherits from only one superclass; multiple inheritance, where a class inherits from multiple superclasses (not supported in Java); multilevel inheritance, where a subclass inherits from a superclass, which in turn inherits from another superclass; and hierarchical inheritance, where multiple classes inherit from the same superclass.',

  {
    question: 'What are access modifiers in Java?',
    answer:
      'Access modifiers in Java are keywords used to control the visibility and accessibility of classes, variables, methods, and constructors in a Java program. There are four access modifiers in Java: public, protected, default (no modifier), and private. They determine whether a class member can be accessed from other classes and packages.',

  {
    question: 'What is the difference between == and equals() method in Java?',
    answer:
      'In Java, == is used to compare the reference values of two objects, while the equals() method is used to compare the contents or values of two objects. The default implementation of the equals() method in the Object class compares the memory addresses of the objects, but it can be overridden in subclasses to provide custom equality comparisons.',
